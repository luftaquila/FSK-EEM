### Wiring

> [!CAUTION]
> Misconnection of the pins may cause permanent damage to the device.

## DIY

### Hardware

[device/hardware/jlcpcb/production_files/](https://github.com/luftaquila/fsk-energymeter/tree/main/device/hardware/jlcpcb/production_files) directory includes gerber, BOM and CPL files for the JLCPCB PCBA(SMT) order.

> [!TIP]
> Exclude LV connector and `L01Z600S05` Hall sensor from the SMT assembly list. Purchase these parts from the global suppliers and solder it yourself to make the device cheaper.

### Firmware

Download the latest `fsk-energymeter-firmware-<version>.zip` from the [Release](https://github.com/luftaquila/fsk-energymeter/releases) and upload the `firmware-release.elf` to the device via ST-Link.

You may use [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) or [OpenOCD for Windows](https://gnutoolchains.com/arm-eabi/openocd/) to upload an ELF file.

Take a look at the OpenOCD script [device/firmware/fsk-energymeter.cfg](https://github.com/luftaquila/fsk-energymeter/blob/main/device/firmware/fsk-energymeter.cfg) if you are using OpenOCD.
